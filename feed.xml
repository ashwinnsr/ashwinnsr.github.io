However, a closer look at the latest <strong>Annual Survey of Unincorporated Sector Enterprises (ASUSE) 2023-24</strong> reveals a stark reality where the entrepreneurial journey for women is fundamentally different and significantly more constrained than for men.</p> <p>ASUSE survey is devoted exclusively to an integrated survey on economic and operational characteristics of unincorporated non-agricultural enterprises in manufacturing, trade and other services sectors to supplement the corporate sector data. Unincorporated non-agricultural establishments include proprietary and partnership establishments (excluding Limited Liability Partnership (LLP) establishments), any society,trust,association,club or body of individuals or Co-operatives, Self-Help Groups (SHGs), Non-Profit Institutions (NPI/NPISH), etc which are neither registered under Companies Act, 1956 nor under Companies Act, 2013. It also includes companies not registred under Sections 2m(i) and 2m(ii) of the Factories Act, 1948.</p> <p>The unincorporated sector has shown robust growth, with the number of establishments rising from 6.50 crore in 2022-23 to 7.34 crore in 2023-24, a remarkable 12.84% increase. The number of establishments in the “Other Services” sector recorded a growth of 23.55% followed by a 13% increase witnessed by the manufacturing sector. During the same period, the Gross Value Added (GVA) which is a key indicator of economic performance rose by 16.52% driven by a 26.17% growth in ‘other services’ sector.</p> <p>In this post, we break down seven key data points that illustrate these “invisible Workshops” where India’s women entrepreneurs operate.</p> <h2 id="1-the-invisible-workshop">1. The Invisible Workshop</h2> <p>For most women in India, the “factory floor” is their own living room. A staggering <strong>75.2%</strong> of women entrepreneurs work from home, compared to just <strong>27%</strong> of men. While home-based work offers flexibility, this means businesses are small and “invisible” to formal support systems.</p> <figure class="text-center"> <img src="/assets/img/Chart1_SurveyAdjusted_InvisibleWorkshop.png" alt="The Invisible Workshop" class="img-fluid" style="max-width: 85%; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);"/> <figcaption class="mt-2 text-muted"> <strong>Figure 1:</strong> Comparison of work location for women vs. men entrepreneurs (ASUSE 2023-24) </figcaption> </figure> <h2 id="2-what-manufacturing-really-means">2. What ‘Manufacturing’ Really Means</h2> <p>When we talk about women in manufacturing, we are often talking about two specific industries. <strong>59%</strong> are in Apparel and Garments, and <strong>15%</strong> are in Tobacco (Beedi) rolling. This high concentration in low-margin, labor-intensive sectors highlights the lack of industrial diversification for women.</p> <figure class="text-center"> <img src="/assets/img/Chart2_Manufacturing_Reality.png" alt="Manufacturing Reality" class="img-fluid" style="max-width: 85%; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);"/> <figcaption class="mt-2 text-muted"> <strong>Figure 2:</strong> Industry composition of women-owned manufacturing enterprises </figcaption> </figure> <h2 id="3-the-solopreneur-trap">3. The Solopreneur Trap</h2> <p>Scaling a business is a monumental challenge for women. Only <strong>3.3%</strong> of women-owned enterprises have any hired workers. The rest are “solopreneurs” who manage everything themselves, compared to nearly triple the hiring rate for men.</p> <figure class="text-center"> <img src="/assets/img/Chart3_SurveyAdjusted_SolopreneurTrap.png" alt="Solopreneur Trap" class="img-fluid" style="max-width: 85%; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);"/> <figcaption class="mt-2 text-muted"> <strong>Figure 3:</strong> Industry composition of solopreneurs </figcaption> </figure> <h2 id="4-the-paper-ceiling">4. The Paper Ceiling</h2> <p>Formalization remains a distant dream for many. <strong>90%</strong> of women-owned businesses remain unregistered, cutting them off from government schemes, formal credit, and legal protections. Men are <strong>4.7x more likely</strong> to have their businesses officially recognized.</p> <figure class="text-center"> <img src="/assets/img/Chart4_Paper_Ceiling.png" alt="Paper Ceiling" class="img-fluid" style="max-width: 85%; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);"/> <figcaption class="mt-2 text-muted"> <strong>Figure 4:</strong> Formalization composition </figcaption> </figure> <h2 id="5-the-sisterhood-effect">5. The Sisterhood Effect</h2> <p>One of the most powerful findings in the data is the “Sisterhood Effect.” When women <em>do</em> scale and hire, they create a safe harbor for other women. Women owners hire other women at <strong>26 times the rate</strong> that men do—emphasizing that investing in women entrepreneurs is a direct investment in the female labor force.</p> <figure class="text-center"> <img src="/assets/img/Chart5_Sisterhood_Effect.png" alt="Sisterhood Effect" class="img-fluid" style="max-width: 85%; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);"/> <figcaption class="mt-2 text-muted"> <strong>Figure 5:</strong> Who do women hire </figcaption> </figure> <h2 id="6-the-digital-divide">6. The Digital Divide</h2> <p>In an increasingly digital economy, women are being left behind. <strong>86%</strong> of women entrepreneurs operate completely offline.

The Credit Gap</h2> <p>Finally, the “Credit Gap” remains a significant hurdle. Only <strong>6%</strong> of women entrepreneurs have access to formal loans, a barrier that prevents them from buying equipment, expanding premises, or surviving economic shocks.</p> <figure class="text-center"> <img src="/assets/img/Chart7_Credit_Gap.png" alt="Credit Gap" class="img-fluid" style="max-width: 85%; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);"/> <figcaption class="mt-2 text-muted"> <strong>Figure 7:</strong> Hurdles in credit access </figcaption> </figure> <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2> <p>The data from ASUSE 2023-24 tells a clear story: women entrepreneurs in India are not just “smaller” versions of male ones.

This project aimed to investigate the type of employment inequality faced by different social groups and how caste and religion shapes employment opportunities and outcomes. Understanding these dynamics is crucial, as employment is a primary determinant of an individual’s life chances and overall socio-economic mobility.</p> <p>A significant body of scholarly work has established the continuing relevance of social institutions like gender, caste, religion, and ethnicity in determining economic trajectories (Harriss-White and Gooptu 2001; Thorat et al 2005; Thorat and Newman 2010; Deshpande 2011). In the Indian context, experimental research provides stark evidence of these barriers. For instance, Thorat and Attewell (2010) found that equally qualified applicants from Muslim and Dalit backgrounds faced significant discrimination in hiring for formal urban jobs compared to their high-caste Hindu counterparts.</p> <p>Drawing on IHDS-II data from 204,568 individuals across 371 districts, our analysis exposes three distinct traps that fragment the Indian labor market. Muslims face a <strong>Geographic Trap</strong>, locked in regions where economic opportunities have evaporated. Adivasis are caught in a <strong>Subsistence Mirage</strong>, characterized by high work intensity but extreme poverty. Dalits encounter a <strong>Distributed Barrier</strong>, facing hiring discrimination that persists across all geographies. Because India treats these unique challenges with uniform policies, decades of reservations and poverty programs have failed to close the inequality gap.</p> <p>A paradox as charted in the Figure 1 will help us in understanding the complexity of employment differences amongst different groups.</p> <figure class="text-center"> <img src="\assets\img\IIHDSemploy\wealth_employment_paradox.png" alt="The Digital Divide" class="img-fluid" style="max-width: 85%; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);"/> <figcaption class="mt-2 text-muted"> <strong>Figure 1:</strong> A bubble chart illustrating that groups with higher mean wealth (Forward castes) have lower employment rates, while the poorest groups (Adivasis) have the highest. </figcaption> </figure> <p>India’s labor market tells a deceptive story. On the surface, employment statistics suggest a simple hierarchy: Adivasis (Scheduled Tribes) have the highest employment rate at 53.3%, followed by Dalits (Scheduled Castes) at 45.5%, while Muslims languish at the bottom with just 35.5% employment. Forward castes follow at 43.3%. These numbers have shaped decades of policy—but they hide a fundamental truth.</p> <p>The “point” of Muslims in this wealth-work relationship is their role as a critical outlier. While SC and ST groups fit the “distress labor” narrative—where lower wealth correlates with higher employment because they must work to survive—Muslims break this pattern. They possess higher mean wealth (15.3 compared to 14.0 for Dalits and 11.3 for Adivasis) yet suffer from much lower employment. This suggests that whereas SC/ST groups are pushed <em>into</em> low-quality labor by poverty, Muslims are being pushed <em>out</em> of the labor market entirely by their geographic concentration in stagnant regions.</p> <p>The story of India’s inequality is not just about who people are, it’s fundamentally about where they live and what kinds of work they can access. Understanding these geographic and quality dimensions transforms our entire approach to addressing marginalization.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="discussion-on-employment-rate">Discussion on Employment Rate</h2> <h3 id="the-muslim-geographic-trap">The Muslim Geographic Trap</h3> <h4 id="where-muslims-live-determines-whether-they-can-work">Where Muslims Live Determines Whether They Can Work</h4> <p>When we analyzed employment rates across India’s 371 districts, a striking pattern emerged. Districts with higher Muslim populations have systematically lower employment rates—not just for Muslims, but for everyone living there. For every 10 percentage point increase in a district’s Muslim population share, the overall employment rate falls by 1.69 percentage points. This correlation of -0.305 is highly significant (p &lt; 0.001).</p> <p>The geographic concentration is stark. Consider Kerala’s Malappuram district, where Muslims comprise 73.8% of the population. Despite Kerala’s reputation for high literacy rates (Malappuram exceeds 94%), the district has the lowest employment rate in our entire dataset at just 25.7%. This may be influenced by heavy migration that happens. Compare this to districts with minimal Muslim populations: Himachal Pradesh’s district 02_8 has 0% Muslim population and 75.6% employment. Chhattisgarh’s district 22_15, also with nearly zero Muslims, boasts 72.5% employment.</p> <p>This isn’t limited to Kerala. Eastern Uttar Pradesh tells the same story. Districts in UP with 70-72% Muslim populations show employment rates hovering between 34-36%. Bihar’s Muslim-majority districts average just 29% employment. Jammu and Kashmir’s Muslim-dominated districts range from 33-48% employment. Across the board, high Muslim concentration predicts low employment for everyone in that district.</p> <figure class="text-center"> <img src="\assets\img\IIHDSemploy\muslim_employment_correlation.png" alt="The Digital Divide" class="img-fluid" style="max-width: 85%; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);"/> <figcaption class="mt-2 text-muted"> <strong>Figure 2:</strong> A scatterplot showing a significant negative correlation (-0.305) between a district's Muslim population share and its overall employment rate. It supports the argument that Muslims are concentrated in economically stagnant regions where jobs are scarce for everyone. </figcaption> </figure> <h4 id="what-happens-within-districts">What Happens Within Districts</h4> <p>When we compared Muslims and Brahmins living in different states, Muslims showed 7.7% lower odds of employment (OR = 0.923, p = 0.015)—a significant disadvantage. But when we compared Muslims and Brahmins living in the <em>same district</em>, this disadvantage completely vanished. The coefficient became +0.001 with a p-value of 0.842, meaning there’s essentially no difference at all.</p> <p>This district fixed effects test proves that the Muslim employment gap is 100% geographic. A case can be made that Muslims are concentrated in places where nobody—Muslim or Hindu—can find adequate employment. Rahman and Rauf (2025) in their regional analysis highlight the acute disadvantages muslims face in high-concentration districts, such as Murshidabad (55.3% literacy) and Uttar Dinajpur (52.1%), where inadequate infrastructure, teacher shortages, and socio-cultural barriers impede access. The Ranganath Mishra Commission’s report and the The Sachar report, showed that the Muslims lagged far behind in their access to education, infrastructure, credit and employment in both public and private sectors. In fact, the literacy rate of Muslim males was only one percent above that of Dalit men—67.6% compared to 66.6%.</p> <h3 id="the-adivasi-subsistence-mirage">The Adivasi Subsistence Mirage</h3> <h4 id="the-paradox-of-high-employment-and-deep-poverty">The Paradox of High Employment and Deep Poverty</h4> <p>The Adivasi employment pattern is the exact opposite of Muslims. Districts with higher Adivasi populations have significantly higher employment rates. The correlation is +0.378 (p &lt; 0.001), even stronger than the Muslim correlation but in the reverse direction. For every 10 percentage point increase in Adivasi population share, district employment rises by 1.79 percentage points.</p> <p>Chhattisgarh’s tribal belt illustrates this dramatically. District 22_15, with 61.4% Adivasi population, has 72.5% employment—the highest in India. District 22_5, with 93.9% Adivasis, shows 63.3% employment. Gujarat’s heavily tribal district 24_20 (96.9% Adivasi) has 62% employment. Mizoram, nearly entirely Adivasi at 97.7%, maintains 53.9% employment. These rates far exceed the national average of 44%.</p> <figure class="text-center"> <img src="\assets\img\IIHDSemploy\st_employment_correlation.png" alt="Adivasi (ST) population share and district employment" class="img-fluid" style="max-width: 85%; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);"/> <figcaption class="mt-2 text-muted"> <strong>Figure 3:</strong> A scatterplot showing a strong positive correlation (+0.378) between Adivasi (ST) population share and district employment. This visualizes the paradox where tribal belts have the highest employment rates in the country, but as the research shows, this is "distress employment" in subsistence agriculture. </figcaption> </figure> <p>These high-employment districts are India’s poorest regions. Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, and Odisha—where Adivasis concentrate—rank among the bottom three states in per capita income. How can the group that works the most remain the poorest? The answer lies in what kind of work they’re doing.</p> <h4 id="why-adivasis-cant-stop-working">Why Adivasis Can’t Stop Working</h4> <p>Adivasis concentrate in forest and hilly states where the economy is based on subsistence agriculture and forest produce collection. In these areas, there is no such thing as “unemployment” in the traditional sense. If you’re not working, you’re not eating. Women collect firewood, tend small rain-fed farms, and gather forest products like tendu leaves, mahua flowers, and sal seeds. Men do agricultural labor, migrate seasonally for construction work, or participate in small-scale mining.</p> <p>This explains why Adivasi women’s labor force participation is extraordinarily high—not because of gender equality, but because of poverty. Everyone must work because there’s no alternative income source. The 13.6% of Adivasis participating in MGNREGA (the government employment guarantee scheme)—the highest rate of any group, four times that of Forward castes—confirms this desperation. When even subsistence work fails, they turn to government workfare programs that pay minimal wages.</p> <p>The states where Adivasis concentrate have structural features that create high employment but low income. Forest reservation laws from the British era restricted Adivasis’ access to land, pushing them into marginal agriculture. Lack of irrigation means dependence on monsoons. Poor roads and infrastructure limit market access, so farmers can’t get good prices. The result is that everyone works constantly but remains trapped in poverty.</p> <h4 id="the-mirage-of-employment-statistics">The Mirage of Employment Statistics</h4> <p>This reveals a fundamental flaw in using employment rates as a welfare metric. Adivasis top the employment rankings at 53.3%, which on paper looks successful. But this “high employment” is actually evidence of extreme deprivation. They’re trapped in subsistence economies where survival requires constant labor but offers no path to accumulation or mobility. Development economists call this “distress employment”—working because you must, not because the work is productive or remunerative.</p> <hr/> <h3 id="the-dalit-distributed-pattern">The Dalit Distributed Pattern</h3> <h4 id="no-geographic-pattern-different-problem">No Geographic Pattern, Different Problem</h4> <p>When the same geographic analysis was run for Dalits, something unexpected happened: nothing. The correlation between Dalit population share and district employment rate was +0.081 with a p-value of 0.120—statistically indistinguishable from zero. Unlike Muslims (who concentrate in low-employment areas) or Adivasis (who concentrate in high-employment areas), Dalits show no geographic pattern at all.</p> <p>Look at the variance in high-Dalit districts. Uttarakhand’s district 05_8 has 66.7% Dalit population and 59.3% employment—quite high. Tamil Nadu’s district 33_9, with 69.8% Dalits, shows 52.5% employment. But Punjab’s district 03_5, with 56.9% Dalits, has just 36.7% employment. Delhi’s heavily Dalit district 07_11 (52.4% Dalit) shows only 30.6% employment. The range is enormous: 30.6% to 59.3%, with no clear relationship to Dalit concentration.</p> <figure class="text-center"> <img src="\assets\img\IIHDSemploy\sc_employment_correlation.png" alt="The Digital Divide" class="img-fluid" style="max-width: 85%; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);"/> <figcaption class="mt-2 text-muted"> <strong>Figure 4:</strong> Shows a near-zero correlation (+0.081, non-significant) between Dalit concentration and district employment. This supports the claim that Dalit disadvantage is not geographic but is distributed across all regions due to caste-based barriers. </figcaption> </figure> <p>Dalits were distributed across every village in India. The caste system assigned them “polluting” occupations like manual scavenging, leather work, agricultural labor, sanitation that existed everywhere. After independence, reservations and urbanization created even more geographic dispersion.</p> <h4 id="within-district-barriers">Within-District Barriers</h4> <p>The lack of geographic pattern suggests Dalit disadvantage operates differently. While we haven’t completed the district fixed effects analysis for Dalits yet, we predict it will show that the Dalit employment penalty <em>shrinks</em> but <em>remains</em> when comparing people in the same district—unlike Muslims, where it disappears entirely. This would indicate that Dalits face actual within-district discrimination in hiring and job access, rather than just being stuck in the wrong places.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="discussion-on-employment-quality">Discussion on Employment quality</h2> <p>Now we will look into what the analysis produced regarding employment quality by looking at contract of work and income. Among Muslims who do find work, the situation remains difficult. Our employment quality analysis shows that 78.1% of working Muslims have casual employment—daily wage work with no security, no advance notice, and no benefits. Only 17.6% have permanent contracts.</p> <p><strong>Insights on Urban Employment:</strong> The low participation of Muslims in MGNREGA (2.1%) underscores their concentration in urban and peri-urban areas. However, this urban presence does not translate into better job quality. Urban Muslim employment is characterized by <strong>extreme informality</strong>, with casualization rates exceeding 78%. Furthermore, Muslims show the lowest access to formal social security among all groups (mean Formal Index of 1.10), making them disproportionately vulnerable to urban economic shocks. This suggests that the urban labor market is as hostile to marginalized groups as the rural one, but through different mechanisms.</p> <figure class="text-center"> <img src="\assets\img\IIHDSemploy\contract_type_distribution.png" alt="Type of Employment" class="img-fluid" style="max-width: 85%; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);"/> <figcaption class="mt-2 text-muted"> <strong>Figure 5:</strong> A stacked bar chart showing the percentage of workers in Casual, Temporary, and Permanent contracts across social groups. It highlights that **85.5% of Adivasis** and **80.1% of Dalits** are in casual labor, compared to much higher permanent contract rates for Forward castes. </figcaption> </figure> <p>Interestingly, only 2.1% of Muslims participate in MGNREGA, the rural employment guarantee scheme, even lower than Forward castes (2.4%) despite Muslims having much lower earnings. This confirms their urban and peri-urban concentration, as MGNREGA is primarily a rural program. Muslims need jobs where they live, not rural workfare programs they can’t access. Therefore a a large urban public employment garuntee programme as a garuntee on par with MGNREGA is needed. Scholars have discussed the ned for am urban employment garuntee which is not just an extension of MGNREGA but reimagines it according urban unemployment issues (Drèze 2020, Bsole 2019, Bhan et al 2024)</p> <p>Among working Dalits, 80.1% have casual employment, 15.7% have permanent jobs, as shown in Figure 5 and mean earnings are ₹43,294 (52.2% less than Forward castes). Adivasis on the other hand face the worst job quality of any group we studied. As Figure 5 shows a devastating 85.5% work in casual employment, contributing to the highest casualization rate of any social group. Only 11.8% have permanent jobs, compared to 40.6% of Forward castes. This means most Adivasis wake up each day uncertain whether they’ll have work, negotiating wages daily with no security whatsoever.</p> <figure class="text-center"> <img src="\assets\img\IIHDSemploy\earnings_distribution.png" alt="Job Security" class="img-fluid" style="max-width: 85%; border-radius: 8px; box-shadow: 0 4px 8px rgba(0,0,0,0.1);"/> <figcaption class="mt-2 text-muted"> <strong>Figure 6:</strong> Boxplots of annual earnings on a **Log Scale**. It shows the persistent shift toward higher earnings for Forward castes, even when ignoring outliers, and highlights the "Subsistence Mirage" of Adivasis who earn the least despite working the most. </figcaption> </figure> <p>The earnings data is even more shocking. Adivasis’ mean annual earnings are ₹35,883—a full 60.4% less than Forward castes. The median is worse: ₹15,000 versus ₹48,000 for Forward castes, a 68% gap. Even after controlling for education, age, gender, and location, Adivasis face a wage penalty of 54.6%—the largest of any group. This means that an Adivasi and a Forward caste person with the same education, working in the same state, will see the Adivasi earn barely half as much.</p> <p>Adivasis work more (53.3% employment rate) but earn so little per job that their annual income per person is ₹19,125 (employment rate × mean earnings). Forward castes work less (39.8% employment rate) but earn so much per job that their annual income reaches ₹36,049—nearly double. Forward castes work 25% less but earn 88% more overall. After controlling for education and location, the analysis shows Dalits still earn 32.2% less—a substantial penalty that suggests occupational segregation or discrimination persists. Their MGNREGA participation of 6.6% indicates that many rely on government workfare when private employment fails.</p> <p>Meanwhile mean annual earnings of muslims is ₹50,567, which is 44.2% less than Forward castes’ ₹90,577. Even after controlling for education, age, gender, and location, Muslims earn 19.9% less (p &lt; 0.001).</p> <h2 id="the-methodological-insight">The Methodological Insight</h2> <h3 id="why-the-comparison-matters">Why the Comparison Matters</h3> <p>The power of this analysis comes from comparing three groups simultaneously. If the Muslim geographic pattern were due to methodological problems—measurement error, model misspecification, or omitted variables—we would expect to see similar patterns for other marginalized groups. But we don’t. We see three completely different patterns that align perfectly with three distinct historical narratives.</p> <p>Muslims show strong negative geographic sorting (-0.305 correlation) because of Partition-era concentration and urban deindustrialization. Adivasis show strong positive geographic sorting (+0.378 correlation) because of British-era forest reservation policies and subsistence economies. Dalits show no geographic pattern (0.081 correlation, not significant) because of caste-based occupational segregation that existed everywhere.</p> <p>This three-way comparison acts as a falsification test. The methodology is sound precisely because it yields different results for groups with different histories. If we only studied Muslims, skeptics could argue the geographic pattern is spurious. Studying all three groups simultaneously proves the patterns are real.</p> <h3 id="rethinking-employment-as-a-metric">Rethinking Employment as a Metric</h3> <p>Perhaps the most important lesson we can learn from this analysis is that employment rates alone are deeply misleading. Adivasis rank first in employment (53.3%) but last in income. Forward castes rank fifth in employment (39.8%) but first in income. The disconnect occurs because employment without adequate wages produces poverty, not prosperity.</p> <p>When Adivasis’ 53.3% employment rate is multiplied by their ₹35,883 mean earnings, we get ₹19,125 in annual income per person—the lowest of any group. When Forward castes’ 39.8% employment rate is multiplied by their ₹90,577 mean earnings, we get ₹36,049—nearly double Adivasis’ income despite working 25% less.</p> <p>This demonstrates that researchers and policymakers must disaggregate employment into at least four components: employment rate (quantity), earnings level (wages), job security (permanent vs. casual), and benefit coverage (formal vs. informal).</p> <p>Our visualization of earnings distribution (Log Scale) highlights the massive spread within groups, yet the persistent shift to the right for Forward castes remains evident. Similarly, the contract type distribution chart reveals that the “high employment” of Adivasis and Dalits is almost entirely fueled by casual labor, whereas the majority of Forward caste jobs carry the security of permanent contracts. High employment with low wages and no security—the Adivasi pattern—is actually evidence of distress, not success.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="conclusion-from-universal-policies-to-targeted-solutions">Conclusion: From Universal Policies to Targeted Solutions</h2> <p>The geography of marginalization in India operates through three distinct mechanisms. Muslims suffer from geographic segregation in economically stagnant districts—a quantity problem requiring place-based development. Adivasis suffer from employment quality deprivation in subsistence economies—a quality problem requiring wage and productivity enhancement.

Originating from clan-based governance systems, they wield significant influence in rural communities, particularly among Jats in Haryana, western Uttar Pradesh, and Rajasthan. While historically credited with conflict resolution and community cohesion, their contemporary role is marred by regressive practices, including honor killings, gender oppression, and extrajudicial punishments. This article examines the evolution, socio-political dynamics, and legal challenges posed by Khap Panchayats, arguing that their persistence reflects systemic failures in governance, judicial inefficiency, and caste hegemony. Khap Panchayats trace their origins to medieval tribal councils (sabhas) that resolved intra-clan disputes. The term khap derives from the Saka word khatrap (clan territory), evolving into a political unit encompassing clusters of villages, often organized around shared gotras (patrilineal clans). By the 14th century, Jat pastoralists migrating to the arid regions of Haryana adopted agriculture, facilitated by Turkic rulers’ irrigation projects. Clan-based khaps emerged as localized governance systems, prioritizing communal harmony and resource management.<br/> Post-independence, these councils transitioned into caste-centric institutions, dominated by upper-caste landowners. Despite India’s constitutional emphasis on Panchayati Raj (decentralized democracy), Khaps retained authority through kinship networks and political patronage, positioning themselves as “custodians of honor” rather than democratic entities.</p> <p>Khap Panchayats have historically played a role in mediating disputes, promoting social welfare initiatives such as discouraging dowry practices, and organizing peasant movements. However, over time, their focus has shifted significantly toward enforcing patriarchal norms. Traditionally, they resolved conflicts through participatory deliberation, offering an alternative to the expensive and time-consuming formal court system. Today, they exert strict control over marriage, dress codes, and social behavior, often blurring the line between cultural tradition and moral policing. Additionally, Khaps have become influential political entities, functioning as vote banks that garner support from leaders across various political parties, including Congress, BJP, and AAP, who endorse their demands to secure electoral advantages. Their authority stems from rural distrust in state institutions. Surveys indicate that villagers perceive formal courts as slow, expensive, and detached from social realities, whereas Khaps deliver swift, culturally resonant verdicts.</p> <p>Khap Panchayats have gained notoriety for their violent enforcement of caste endogamy and rigid gender norms. Couples who marry outside their caste or gotra often face brutal retribution, as seen in high-profile cases such as the Manoj-Babli murder in 2007, where a Jat couple was killed for violating intra-gotra marriage rules, resulting in life sentences for five perpetrators. Similarly, in 2018, Pranay Perumalla, a Dalit man, was hacked to death for marrying an upper-caste woman. Women, in particular, bear the brunt of Khap violence, enduring forced marriages, female foeticide, and degrading acts of public humiliation, such as being paraded naked. Additionally, individuals accused of defying Khap diktats are subjected to extrajudicial punishments, including torture, land seizures, and archaic methods of “proving” innocence, such as holding red-hot irons. These practices highlight the systemic human rights abuses perpetuated by these councils. The Supreme Court has condemned Khaps as “unconstitutional,” blaming authorities for complicity in honor killings. In Shakti Vahini v. Union of India (2018), the Court mandated state intervention to protect inter-caste couples. However, enforcement remains lax due to political interference and police apathy.</p> <p>Clan loyalty (bhaichara) ensures collective adherence to Khap diktats. Grassroots democratic institutions are overshadowed by Khap dominance. Leaders like Haryana CM Manohar Lal Khattar have defended Khaps as “scientific,” while parties avoid antagonizing their vote banks. Upper-caste landowners use Khaps to perpetuate caste hierarchies, suppressing Dalit assertion and women’s autonomy. For instance, Haryana’s skewed sex ratio (722 females per 1,000 males in 2001) underscores Khaps’ role in normalizing female foeticide. Economic disparities are a foundational pillar of Khap Panchayats’ dominance, particularly in regions like Haryana. The distribution of land ownership reveals stark inequalities. Despite constituting 19.5% of the population, Dalits own a mere 1.24% of the total cultivable land. A small elite of large landowners, representing just 5.58% of the population, control a disproportionate 32.1% of agricultural land. Redistributing land to marginalized communities could dismantle entrenched caste hierarchies and diminish the influence of Khaps. However, such reforms face significant obstacles, including political resistance and the entrenched power of elite groups who benefit from the status quo. These structural barriers continue to impede meaningful agrarian reform and perpetuate systemic inequality.</p> <p>What are the possible Judicial Responses and the Path Forward? While courts have criminalized honor killings, systemic change requires- prosecuting Khap leaders and complicit officials under anti-terror laws, strengthening Panchayati Raj with quotas for women and Dalits and educating rural communities on constitutional rights and gender equality. Khap Panchayats epitomize the clash between tradition and modernity in India. Their endurance highlights the state’s failure to deliver justice and equity, forcing marginalized groups to rely on oppressive informal systems. Combating Khaps necessitates dismantling caste patriarchy, ensuring land reform, and revitalizing democratic institutions. Until then, India’s quest for social justice remains incomplete.</p> <p>References:</p> <p>Kumar, A. (2012). Khap panchayats: A socio-historical overview. Economic and Political Weekly, 59-64.

While significant progress has been made, the landscape is characterized by regional disparities, socioeconomic inequalities, and cultural nuances. This essay delves into the complexities of family planning practices in India, particularly focusing on urban and rural differences, the role of education and socioeconomic status, cultural influences, and the effectiveness of government interventions. Uttar Pradesh (UP), as a case study, exemplifies the challenges and opportunities inherent in family planning initiatives. Awareness of family planning methods in India is nearly universal, particularly regarding modern methods such as female sterilization and condoms. Studies indicate that women in urban areas and larger cities possess high levels of knowledge about these methods. However, awareness about emergency contraception and female condoms is significantly lower. For instance, only a small proportion of women in Aligarh and Varanasi are familiar with female condoms (Ansary &amp; Anisujjaman, 2012). Despite this widespread awareness, the actual usage of contraceptives remains inconsistent, with a substantial Knowledge, Attitude, and Practice (KAP) gap. This gap is influenced by health concerns, cultural barriers, and limited accessibility to contraceptives in many regions (Singh et al., 2016). Bridging this gap requires a multifaceted approach. Health education campaigns that provide accurate information about contraceptive methods, their usage, and potential side effects are essential. Programs tailored to the unique needs of specific communities can improve adoption rates. These efforts should be accompanied by improving access to contraceptives, particularly for marginalized groups.</p> <p>The divide between urban and rural areas in family planning practices is stark. While urban populations generally have better access to family planning services, urban slum dwellers face challenges similar to those in rural areas. A study in six cities of UP revealed that slum residents often rely on sterilization or forego contraception altogether, reflecting a lack of access to temporary methods (Speizer et al., 2012). Conversely, rural areas face additional hurdles due to inadequate health infrastructure and cultural conservatism. To address these disparities, investments in health infrastructure are imperative. Rural areas require more community health centers, staffed by trained workers who can offer a variety of contraceptive options. In urban slums, mobile clinics and outreach programs can deliver family planning services directly to those in need. These measures would ensure equitable access to family planning services across geographic and socioeconomic divides.</p> <p>Socioeconomic factors significantly influence family planning practices. Wealthier and more educated women are more likely to use modern contraceptive methods, while poorer women and those with less education face higher unmet needs for family planning. Education, in particular, plays a transformative role, equipping women with the knowledge to make informed decisions about their reproductive health (Halli et al., 2024). Targeting socioeconomic inequalities requires a multi-pronged strategy. Providing subsidies for contraceptives, expanding public healthcare, and enhancing educational opportunities for women are crucial steps. Empowering women economically and socially can also mitigate the systemic barriers they face. For instance, vocational training programs that improve women’s financial independence can positively influence their family planning choices.</p> <p>Cultural attitudes and gender norms profoundly impact family planning practices in India. In many northern states, a strong preference for male children continues to shape reproductive behaviors. This cultural norm often results in unintended pregnancies and inhibits the adoption of contraceptive methods. Furthermore, women in patriarchal societies, particularly those with low autonomy, face significant barriers in negotiating family planning decisions (Dyson &amp; Moore, 1983). Challenging these norms requires community-level interventions that engage both men and women. Programs like the “Saas-Bahu Sammelans” (Mother-in-law and Daughter-in-law meetings) have proven effective in fostering discussions around family planning within a culturally sensitive framework (Speizer et al., 2012). Additionally, increasing female autonomy through education and policy interventions can empower women to make decisions about their reproductive health.</p> <p>The Indian government has undertaken numerous initiatives to enhance family planning services. Programs such as Mission Parivar Vikas aim to increase contraceptive use by focusing on high-fertility states like UP and Bihar. These initiatives emphasize education, availability of diverse contraceptive methods, and community engagement through innovative tools like digital platforms and outreach programs (Sharma et al., 2021). However, the persistence of regional disparities and socioeconomic barriers highlights the need for more nuanced, localized strategies. For greater effectiveness, government policies must be tailored to address the unique needs of various communities. Expanding health infrastructure, particularly in underserved rural and urban slum areas, is critical. Furthermore, male involvement in family planning discussions and decision-making processes can reduce biases and promote shared responsibility in reproductive health. The unmet need for family planning is particularly pronounced among young women aged 15-24, with significant regional disparities across India. Northern states like UP, Bihar, and parts of the northeast exhibit higher unmet needs due to factors such as poverty, low media exposure, and illiteracy. Spatial analyses reveal clusters of unmet needs, emphasizing the importance of targeted resource allocation (Sharma et al., 2021). Addressing these unmet needs requires a focus on education and awareness campaigns that prioritize adolescents and young couples. Geographic targeting, informed by spatial data, can ensure that resources are directed to districts with the highest unmet needs. Offering a variety of contraceptive options and ensuring their availability in these regions are essential steps. Southern states like Kerala and Tamil Nadu exemplify the potential of well-implemented family planning programs. These regions have achieved higher rates of contraceptive use and lower fertility rates due to better education, robust healthcare infrastructure, and greater female autonomy (Joshi et al., 2021). These success stories underscore the importance of investing in women’s education and healthcare as foundational elements of effective family planning. Replicating these successful strategies in states like UP can yield significant benefits. Policies that prioritize women’s empowerment and healthcare investments can bridge the gaps in family planning outcomes across regions.</p> <p>India’s family planning efforts have achieved progress but continue to grapple with challenges of regional, socioeconomic, and cultural diversity. Bridging the KAP gap, addressing unmet needs, and dismantling cultural barriers are critical to realizing the full potential of these programs. By prioritizing localized interventions, improving infrastructure, and fostering female empowerment, India can achieve equitable and sustainable family planning outcomes. The experiences of successful regions offer a roadmap for scaling best practices, ensuring that no one is left behind in the journey toward better reproductive health and family well-being.</p> <h2 id="analysis">Analysis</h2> <p>Birth spacing, defined as the temporal interval between successive births, plays a crucial role in maternal and child health outcomes. The World Health Organization recommends an optimal birth-to-pregnancy interval of at least 24 months, which translates to a minimum birth-to-birth interval of 33 months when accounting for gestational period (WHO, 2005). This recommendation is supported by substantial empirical evidence demonstrating the positive correlation between adequate birth spacing and improved health outcomes for both mothers and children. Maternal health is significantly impacted by birth spacing intervals. The maternal depletion hypothesis suggests that insufficient intervals between pregnancies prevent women from adequately replenishing their nutritional reserves, which are depleted during pregnancy and lactation. This depletion can lead to maternal undernutrition, compromised body mass index, and increased risk of nutritional deficiencies, particularly anemia (van Eijsden, 2008; Conde Agudelo, 200). Multiple comprehensive studies, including Rutstein’s (2008) analysis of 52 Demographic and Health Surveys and Conde-Agudelo’s (2006) meta-analysis of 67 global studies, have established strong correlations between suboptimal birth spacing and adverse perinatal outcomes. Notably, pregnancies conceived within six months of a previous birth demonstrate a 42-61% higher probability of resulting in low birth weight compared to optimally spaced pregnancies (Wendt, 2012). Furthermore, inter-pregnancy intervals shorter than 18 months significantly increase the risks of preterm birth and small-for-gestational-age (SGA) outcomes. The implications of inadequate birth spacing extend well into childhood development. Research indicates that children born after short birth intervals face substantially higher risks of stunting, wasting, and being underweight. A study in El Salvador demonstrated that children born within 24 months of their siblings had 52% higher odds of stunting compared to those born after longer intervals(Gribble, 2009). These nutritional deficits have long-term consequences. Stunted children frequently experience cognitive delays, reduced educational achievement, and diminished economic productivity in adulthood. Moreover, women who were stunted as children face increased risks during their own pregnancies, perpetuating an intergenerational cycle of undernutrition. The significance of these outcomes is underscored by estimates suggesting that stunting and underweight status each account for approximately 17% of child mortality, while wasting contributes to 11.5% of child deaths (Bhutta, 2013).</p> <div class="table-responsive"> <table class="table table-bordered table-hover mt-4"> <caption><strong>Table 1:</strong> Current use of family planning methods among currently married women aged 15–49 years in Uttar Pradesh (NFHS-4 vs NFHS-5)</caption> <thead class="table-dark"> <tr> <th>Method</th> <th colspan="2" class="text-center">NFHS-4 (%)</th> <th colspan="2" class="text-center">NFHS-5 (%)</th> </tr> <tr> <th>Current Use of Family Planning Methods (currently married women age 15–49 years)</th> <th>Urban</th> <th>Rural</th> <th>Urban</th> <th>Rural</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Any method</strong></td> <td>67.6</td> <td>60.8</td> <td>62.4</td> <td>45.5</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Any modern method</strong></td> <td>48.6</td> <td>43.2</td> <td>44.5</td> <td>31.7</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Female sterilization</td> <td>13.5</td> <td>18.0</td> <td>16.9</td> <td>17.3</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Male sterilization</td> <td>0.1</td> <td>0.1</td> <td>0.1</td> <td>0.1</td> </tr> <tr> <td>IUD/PPIUD</td> <td>2.1</td> <td>1.3</td> <td>1.5</td> <td>1.2</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Pill</td> <td>4.4</td> <td>5.4</td> <td>4.4</td> <td>1.9</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Condom</td> <td>27.1</td> <td>16.6</td> <td>19.1</td> <td>10.8</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Injectables</td> <td>0.9</td> <td>1.2</td> <td>1.2</td> <td>0.4</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <p>In NFHS data set the indicator “Current Use of Family Planning Methods (currently married women age 15–49 years)” has the following sub-indicators: Any method, Any modern method, Female sterilization, Male sterilization, IUD?PPIUD, Pill, Condom and Injectables</p> <p>Where ‘Any method’ includes other methods that are not shown separately; ‘Any modern method’ includes other modern methods that are not shown separately. The evolution of India’s family planning strategy has undergone significant transformations since its inception. While initial contraceptive initiatives encompassed various modern methods, including male sterilization, the program’s focus shifted predominantly toward female sterilization by the late 1970s (de Oliveira IT e al, 2014). The program’s exclusive focus on women persisted through the mid-1990s, reflecting a gender-biased approach to reproductive health services (Singh, 2009).</p> <p>A paradigm shift occurred in 1998 with the introduction of an informed choice model, eliminating targets and incentives from the family planning framework (de Oliveira IT, 2014). Despite this progressive policy change, contraceptive utilization in India remains influenced by a complex interplay of factors spanning personal, interpersonal, partner-related, service-related, and method-specific dimensions. The challenges in accessing family planning services are particularly pronounced in resource-constrained settings like India, where multiple barriers persist. These include restricted contraceptive options, inadequate service accessibility and quality, cultural and religious opposition, concerns about adverse effects, and deeply embedded gender-based constraints.</p> <div class="table-responsive"> <table class="table table-bordered mt-4" style="max-width: 600px; margin: 0 auto;"> <caption><strong>Table 2:</strong> Demand for family planning methods in Uttar Pradesh (NFHS-4 vs NFHS-5)</caption> <thead class="table-primary"> <tr> <th>Indicator</th> <th>NFHS-4 (%)</th> <th>NFHS-5 (%)</th> <th>Change</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td><strong>Demand for Family Planning</strong></td> <td>66%</td> <td>76%</td> <td class="text-success">+10%</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Unmet Need for Family Planning</strong></td> <td>13%</td> <td>9%</td> <td class="text-success">-4%</td> </tr> <tr> <td><strong>Contraceptive Discontinuation</strong></td> <td>33%</td> <td>50%</td> <td class="text-danger">+17%</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> </div> <p>The demand for family planning among married women aged 15–49 years has increased significantly, rising from 66% in NFHS-4 to 76% in NFHS-5, reflecting a 10% improvement. This progress has contributed to a reduction in the unmet need for family planning, which has decreased from 13% in NFHS-4 to 9% in NFHS-5. However, a concerning trend has emerged in contraceptive discontinuation rates, which have surged from 33% in NFHS-4 to 50% in NFHS-5, indicating a negative shift (Tripathi, 2023).</p> <p>Female sterilization remains the predominant contraceptive method in contemporary India, with its adoption significantly influenced by women’s religious background, educational attainment, and occupational status(Jain, 2011; de Oliveira IT et al, 2014). The prevalence of this permanent contraceptive method is further perpetuated by informational deficits and misconceptions regarding temporary contraceptive alternatives.</p> <figure class="text-center"> <img src="/assets/img/NFHSgraphs/female-sterilization-map.png" alt="Map of female sterilization distribution in Uttar Pradesh" class="img-fluid" style="max-width: 90%;"/> <figcaption class="mt-2"><strong>Figure 1:</strong> Comparison of female sterilization percentage and its distribution across districts in Uttar Pradesh (NFHS-5). The map reveals significant inter-district variation, with some districts showing rates as high as 25% while others remain below 10%.</figcaption> </figure> <p>Additionally, the limited accessibility and affordability of modern temporary contraceptive methods often constrain women’s contraceptive choices, inadvertently promoting sterilization as the default option. The situation is further complicated by deeply entrenched socio cultural misconceptions surrounding male sterilization, particularly the erroneous beliefs that vasectomy diminishes sexual desire and compromises physical strength. As can be seen in table 1, where the female sterilization percentage for both rural 18% and urban areas 13% is drastically more than the percentage of male sterilization (Rural and Urban= 0.1%). This hasn’t changed over the years when the NFHS-5 survey is compared to NFHS-4 survey. For both NFHS-4 and NFHS-5 total male sterilizations amounts to 0.1%. Misconceptions contribute significantly to the public’s resistance toward male sterilization as a viable contraceptive alternative, thereby reinforcing the disproportionate burden of contraceptive responsibility on women (Perry, 2016). According to a qualitative study conducted among women in Mumbai’s low-income neighborhoods, poor women believe that choosing to get sterilized helps them effectively manage their fertility, which improves their emotional and sexual well-being after the procedure. Most of them have no regret after sterilization because of all these circumstances (Brault, 2016). In Uttar pradesh majority of the states show a drop in female sterilization percentage indicating a rise in usage of other modern methods including IUD, pills, contraceptive and injectables.</p> <h2 id="socioeconomic-backwardness-and-family-planning">Socioeconomic Backwardness and Family Planning</h2> <p>Uttar Pradesh has 35 districts notified as industrially and socio-economically backward. The University Grants Commission has identified 55 out of the existing 70 districts of Uttar Pradesh as backward which are below the national average in total literacy based on the 2001 census.</p> <figure class="text-center"> <img src="/assets/img/NFHSgraphs/backward-districts-map.png" alt="Map showing socio-economically backward districts in Uttar Pradesh" class="img-fluid rounded d-block mx-auto"/> <figcaption class="mt-2 text-center"> Distribution of socio-economically backward districts in Uttar Pradesh, highlighting regions requiring targeted family planning interventions. </figcaption> </figure> <p>Even with huge rural backwardness NFHS-5 data doesn’t show much rural-urban divide between the usage of condoms, pills, IUD/PPIUD (%) and injectables or any other modern methods as can be seen in Figure 1.</p> <figure class="text-center"> <img src="/assets/img/NFHSgraphs/condom-trend.png" alt="Comparison of usage of condoms as contraceptives" class="img-fluid" style="max-width: 95%;"/> <figcaption><strong>Figure 2:</strong> Modern contraceptive methods usage across districts in Uttar Pradesh showing increasing adoption of temporary methods alongside persistent reliance on sterilization.</figcaption> </figure> <p>Modern methods used other than the ones mentioned have increased all over in multiple districts as you can see in Figure 3. According to HMIS reports available with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, the National Family Welfare Program has been implemented satisfactorily, with IUCD insertions rising from 52,75,440 to 55,40,743 and sterilisations rising from 40,30,409 to 40,70,597 between 2014–15 and 2015–16. In accordance with the National Population Policy, 2000’s policy framework for population stabilization, family planning has been a top priority for the government and has been actively promoted through the National Rural Health Mission, which was established in 2005. Addressing the unmet need for contraception and reaching a stable population by 2045—at a level compatible with the demands of social development, sustainable economic growth, and environmental protection—were the primary goals of the National Population Policy of 2000. The nation’s Total Fertility Rate (TFR) decreased from 2.7 in 2006 to 2.2 in 2016 as a result of government programs (NFHS-IV). Between 1990 and 2000, the decadal growth rate was 21.54 percent; between 2001 and 2011, it was 17.64 percent. Out of 36 states and territories, 24 have already attained the replacement level TFR of 2.1 or below, and the crude birth rate has decreased from 23.8 in 2005 to 20.8 (SRS 2015). Such government interventions have played a key role in usage of modern methods and techniques for family planning.</p> <figure class="text-center"> <img src="/assets/img/NFHSgraphs/modern-methods-trend.png" alt="Comparison of any modern methods other than the ones mentioned in datasheet" class="img-fluid" style="max-width: 95%;"/> <figcaption><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Modern contraceptive methods usage across districts in Uttar Pradesh showing increasing adoption of temporary methods alongside persistent reliance on sterilization.</figcaption> </figure> <h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3> <p>The landscape of family planning in India is shaped by a complex interplay of regional, socioeconomic, and cultural factors. While significant strides have been made, challenges persist, particularly in bridging the gaps in awareness, accessibility, and adoption of contraceptive methods. Rural-urban disparities highlight the necessity of targeted interventions tailored to the needs of diverse populations. Investments in healthcare infrastructure, particularly in underserved areas, are essential for equitable access to family planning resources. Education and socioeconomic empowerment emerge as transformative forces in improving family planning outcomes. Educated and economically independent women are better equipped to make informed decisions about their reproductive health. Consequently, policies that prioritize women’s education and provide financial support for contraceptive use are critical. Addressing entrenched cultural norms and gender biases, particularly in patriarchal regions, requires community engagement initiatives that foster dialogue and shared decision-making between men and women. Government initiatives like Mission Parivar Vikas underscore the importance of localized, data-driven strategies in addressing unmet family planning needs. By focusing on high-fertility regions and employing innovative outreach tools, such programs have laid the groundwork for progress. However, the persistence of issues like low male participation and high contraceptive discontinuation rates necessitates a more inclusive approach that balances the responsibility of family planning between genders.</p> <p>–</p> <h2 id="references">References</h2> <p>Ansary, R., &amp; Anisujjaman, M.

The movie is an anxiety-driven ride and manages to masterfully capture the intensity and pressure of a world driven by high-stakes gambling, speculative capitalism, and the relentless pursuit of wealth. Howard Ratner, played by Adam Sandler, embodies the chaos and desperation inherent in a system driven by speculative gambles, much like the volatile markets and frequent economic crises that plague our current economic system. In both, Howard’s life is an allegory of the high-risk behavior that modern capitalism encourages, always speculating on uncertain futures while our grasp on the present loosens.</p> <h2 id="the-cinematic-world-of-speculative-anxiety">The Cinematic World of Speculative Anxiety</h2> <p>The Safdie brothers set the mood of constant motion and anxiousness right from the start of the movie. The tale begins in Ethiopia when miners find a rare black opal, which becomes the film’s central gemstone. After the opal is extracted and placed in Howard’s hands, the action picks up speed. The camera observes this entire process with unrelenting intensity.</p> <p>High-stakes wagers, heated conversations, and the constant fear of violence from the loan sharks that he owes enormous sums of money to dominate Howard’s life. The audience is lured into Howard’s chaotic world as the stakes mount, where every choice he makes appears to drive him closer to impending catastrophe.</p> <p>Adam Sandler’s Howard Ratner is a man who embodies the spirit of speculative capitalism. He is constantly over-leveraged, betting other people’s money on high-risk gambles. His obsession with winning, and the adrenaline that accompanies it, drives him to make decisions that not only jeopardize his financial future but also his relationships with those closest to him.</p> <p>The 2022 UK recession crisis, where pension schemes teetered on the edge of collapse due to risky investment strategies, underscores how deeply embedded speculative gambling has become in all areas of the capitalist economy (Partington, 2022a). Howard seeks quick profits and high returns by pushing the boundaries of risk. Speculation and betting are equivalent to the satisfaction of his sexual desires—we are flashed with scenes where the fruition of his speculation incites a response very similar to the satisfaction of one’s sexual desires.</p> <p>Just as Howard pawns Garnett’s championship ring to place a massive bet, UK pension schemes invested in risky financial products, triggering a market collapse that nearly wiped out the savings of millions of ordinary people. The intervention by the Bank of England (Partington, 2022b) to prevent disaster is reminiscent of the last-minute reprieves Howard receives in the film, but with the lingering knowledge that these temporary fixes cannot stave off inevitable collapse forever.</p> <h2 id="the-fetishism-of-the-black-opal">The Fetishism of the Black Opal</h2> <p>At the heart of <em>Uncut Gems</em> is the black opal, a rare and valuable gemstone that Howard has smuggled into the United States from Ethiopia. For Howard, the opal represents a way out of his financial troubles—a potential million-dollar windfall that could solve all of his problems. For Kevin Garnett, the opal holds a different kind of value. The basketball star becomes fixated on the gem, believing that its power will enhance his performance on the court.</p> <div class="text-center my-4"> <img src="/assets/img/UncutGems.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded" alt="Uncut Gems film still" style="max-width: 80%;"/> <p class="text-muted mt-2"><small>The frenetic pace of Uncut Gems mirrors the anxiety of speculative capitalism</small></p> </div> <p>In Marx’s theory of commodity fetishism, commodity exchange under capitalism are mask the labor and exploitation that went into their production (Marx, 1993). The opal, which Howard plans to auction off for a huge profit, becomes a symbol of hope and fortune for him, while the human labor that extracted the gem in Ethiopia is completely erased from the narrative. This mirrors the capitalist practice of commodifying labor and natural resources, transforming them into objects of desire that take on lives of their own.</p> <p>Howard’s obsession with the opal blinds him to the reality of his situation. Despite mounting debts and the constant threat of violence from loan sharks, he refuses to sell the opal to Garnett directly, convinced that he can get a higher price at auction. This refusal to let go of the gem, even when it could save him, speaks to the larger theme of capitalist greed and the inability to recognize when enough is enough.</p> <p>Ratner is a lone individual in his story, his personal and social relationships reduced to mere transactions. Georg Lukács’ 1923 article on reification had a significant impact on critical theory. Lukács paired Weber’s analysis of bureaucracy, which extends this instrumentalizing approach to all social spheres, with Marx’s critique of the “fetishism of commodities,” which makes social connections between people appear as measurable and thing-like.</p> <p>When one views things only from the standpoint of their marketability, reification becomes “the necessary, immediate reality of every person living in capitalist society” (Lukács, 1972). This can be used to describe an instrumentalizing attitude toward other people, objects (whose qualitative features are reduced to quantitative terms), and aspects of one’s own personality. Our protagonist’s world resembles this to a great extent, caught up in the web of unethical decisions and an even more unethical economic system.</p> <h2 id="extractive-capitalism-and-the-indian-context">Extractive Capitalism and the Indian Context</h2> <p>At its core, <em>Uncut Gems</em> is a critique of the unsustainable nature of capitalism, particularly its speculative, high-risk aspects. The export of primary commodities, such as agricultural and mineral materials, rather than manufactured goods is known as “extractive capitalism” (James Petras, 2013). Neoliberal capitalism coupled with predatory extractive industries and government assistance always results in an excess of dispossessed and depeasantized laborers who migrate seasonally in an attempt to diversify their sources of income between mining and agriculture (Roy Chowdhury &amp; Lahiri-Dutt, 2016).</p> <p>In the Indian context, gambling regulations reveal interesting contradictions. The majority of gambling operations are regulated or controlled, with a few exceptions such as lotteries and horse racing. Since gambling is a state matter in India, only the state governments have the authority to legalize and regulate it for their own regions. The general law governing gaming in India is the Public Gaming Act 1867. India’s regulatory framework distinguishes between two types of games: those requiring skill and those requiring chance—a distinction that mirrors capitalism’s own blurred lines between “calculated risk” and pure speculation.</p> <p>The suspense in the movie reaches unbearably high levels as it speeds toward its climax. Howard makes a huge three-way parlay wager on Garnett’s performance in a crucial NBA game in an attempt to pay off his loan shark, Arno. There’s a lot of suspense in this scene as Howard watches the game and hopes that a win will finally liberate him.</p> <p><em>Uncut Gems</em>, however, is not a movie that provides simple answers. At the very end, as Howard celebrates his $1.2 million payday and Garnett’s team wins, the movie pulls off a vicious, unexpected turn. Phil, one of Arno’s hired goons, shoots Howard in the face, killing him instantly. The suddenness of this act is a stark reminder that in the world of <em>Uncut Gems</em>, no amount of money or success can protect you from the consequences of your actions. The capitalist dream that Howard has been chasing throughout the film is revealed to be a lie, as his life is cut short just as he believes he has won.</p> <h2 id="conclusion-a-cinematic-critique-of-capitalist-irrationality">Conclusion: A Cinematic Critique of Capitalist Irrationality</h2> <p><em>Uncut Gems</em> and the current state of the economy serve as examples of how speculation and gambling—which are essential components of capitalist systems—cause chaos, instability, and fragility. Unrestrained profit-seeking breeds financial systems based on “fictitious capital”—value existing only in the mind—much as the derivatives and other intricate instruments that precipitated the global financial crisis of 2008.</p> <p>Howard’s desperate acts are similar to those of capitalist organizations that make risky investments without thinking through the repercussions, ultimately risking millions of people’s livelihoods. Despite his slight success, Howard’s eventual downfall illustrates how unsustainable a capitalist system that puts short-term gains ahead of long-term stability is.</p> <p>The obsession with maximizing returns—whether in the diamond district of Manhattan or in British pension funds—perpetuates a cycle of risk-taking and collapse, where the benefits are enjoyed by the few, and the costs are borne by the many. Ultimately, just as the current financial crises call for a fundamental restructuring of economic systems, <em>Uncut Gems</em> offers a window into capitalism’s inherent instability through the unstable camerawork showcasing the cascading effects of Ratner’s choices.</p> <p>The film portrays a world where there are no “safe bets”—where the pursuit of profit leads to fragility and chaos. In both cinema and real life, the lesson is clear: the speculative, casino-like nature of capitalism is unsustainable, and only by fundamentally transforming these systems can we hope to escape the perpetual cycles of crisis and collapse.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="bibliography">Bibliography</h2> <p>Althusser, L.
